# Course 15: Capstone: Basic GAN for Custom Data üéØüñåÔ∏è

## Overview
This culminating course brings your GenAI Architect journey to a pinnacle by mastering Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) - the crown jewel of generative AI. You'll build a custom image generator from scratch, learning to create and iterate through failures, embodying the true spirit of AI innovation.

## Key Learning Objectives
- Master GAN architecture and training dynamics
- Implement custom image generation pipelines
- Debug and iterate on GAN training failures
- Deploy generative models for real-world applications
- Cultivate the architect's mindset for complex AI projects

## Core Topics

### 1. **GAN Foundations: Adversarial Training** ‚öîÔ∏è
**Greatest AI Breakthrough Since 2014**: GANs pit two networks against each other - Generator creates fakes, Discriminator detects fakes, both improving simultaneously until fakes become indistinguishable from real data.

**Why Game-Changing**: Traditional models predict labels, GANs generate entire new samples. Represents the paradigm shift from classification to generation.

**The GAN Loop**:
1. Discriminator D: Binary classifier (real/fake)
2. Generator G: Learn mapping from noise to data distribution
3. Objective: min_G max_D V(D,G) = E[log D(x)] + E[log (1 - D(G(z)))]
4. Convergence: Nash equilibrium where G fools D 50% of the time

### 2. **Architecture Deep Dive** üèóÔ∏è
**Generator Network**: Typically convolutional transpose layers:
- Input: Noise vector z ~ N(0,1)
- Upsampling through deconvolutional layers
- Output: Generated image matching real data dimensions

**Discriminator Network**: Standard CNN classifier:
- Feature extraction with convolutional layers
- Binary output: prob_real(prob_fake)
- Trained on both real and generated samples

**Modern Variations**:
- **DCGAN (2015)**: Convolutional GAN with batch norm and specific activations
- **WGAN (2017)**: Wasserstein distance instead of JS divergence
- **StyleGAN (2018)**: Multi-scale generation with style mapping
- **BigGAN (2018)**: Large-scale GANs for high-resolution images

### 3. **Training Challenges & Solutions** üöß
**Mode Collapse**: Generator produces limited sample varieties
**Solution**: Mini-batch discrimination, experience replay, PacGAN

**Training Instability**: Oscillating loss, vanishing gradients
**Solution**: Wasserstein GAN, different learning rates, gradient penalties

**Metric Issues**: Standard loss doesn't correlate with image quality
**Solution**: Inception Score, Frechet Inception Distance (FID), Perceptual Path Length

### 4. **Custom Data Adaptation** üìä
**Dataset Preparation**:
- Image resizing and normalization
- Batch creation with DataLoader
- Domain-specific considerations (art styles, objects, etc.)

**Hyperparameter Tuning**:
- Learning rates: Typically separate for G/D
- Batch sizes: Usually 64-128 for stability
- Architecture width: Balancing capacity vs.training time

### 5. **Deployment & Production** üöÄ
**Model Serialization**: Saving/loading in PyTorch
**Inference Pipeline**: Generating new samples efficiently
**Evaluation Framework**: Quantitative and qualitative metrics
