# Course 5: Best Practices 🗂️  
_Introduction to Generative Models – Distributions, Sampling, and Synthetic Data_  

---

## 🎯 1. Mindset & Goal Setting  
- Embrace a **probabilistic mindset**: Think in terms of distributions, uncertainty, and randomness.  
- Set clear objectives:  
  - **Short-term (1 week)**: Visualize and sample common distributions.  
  - **Mid-term (2–3 weeks)**: Implement Monte Carlo and importance sampling labs end-to-end.  
  - **Long-term (1 month)**: Integrate sampling into a simple generative pipeline.  
- Cultivate **experimental curiosity**: Frame every hypothesis (e.g., “Will Gaussian vs. uniform sampling affect my VAE?”) and test it.

---

## 🗺️ 2. Structured Learning Architecture  
- **Daily Routine**:  
  - 30 min theory (distributions, weighted sampling)  
  - 45 min hands-on lab (code notebooks)  
  - 15 min reflection & notes  
- **70:20:10 Rule**:  
  - 70 % implementing code labs and mini-projects  
  - 20 % studying mathematical derivations and visualizations  
  - 10 % exploring related research or blog posts  
- **Progressive Scaffolding**:  
  - Start with uniform and normal distributions  
  - Advance to mixture models and complex targets  
  - Conclude with Bayesian inference and rare-event modeling

## 🔧 3. Technical Best Practices  
- **Reproducibility**:  
  - Fix random seeds for NumPy/PyTorch.  
  - Log sampling parameters (distribution name, hyperparameters, sample size).  
- **Code Quality**:  
  - Vectorize operations; avoid Python loops for large samples.  
  - Write modular functions (`sample_distribution()`, `compute_weights()`, `estimate_expectation()`).  
  - Include docstrings: input, output shapes, mathematical formulas.  
- **Data Handling**:  
  - Validate that samples cover the support of the target distribution.  
  - Visualize histograms and density plots after each sampling step.  
  - Store intermediate arrays for post-hoc analysis (e.g., weight distributions).

## ⚖️ 4. Ethical & Practical Considerations  
- **Synthetic Data Ethics**:  
  - Clearly document that generated data is not real and should not be used for sensitive decisions.  
  - When augmenting datasets, ensure synthetic samples do not amplify biases.  
- **Statistical Integrity**:  
  - Report Effective Sample Size (ESS) and variance of estimates.  
  - Use self-normalized weights when estimates may diverge.  
- **Transparency**:  
  - Annotate code notebooks with commentary on where sampling assumptions may fail.

## 💡 5. Content Creation Approach  
- **Modular Chapters**:  
  1. Theory of Distributions  
  2. Basic Sampling Labs  
  3. Advanced Techniques (Importance, MCMC)  
  4. Bayesian Inference Case Study  
  5. Capstone: Integrate into a Generative Model  
- **Engaging Narratives**:  
  - Use analogies (e.g., “drawing marbles from a bag,” “rare bird spotting”) to ground abstract concepts.  
  - Start each section with a question or real-world scenario.  
- **Visual Aids**:  
  - Animated GIFs of sampling histograms evolving.  
  - Interactive sliders in notebooks to tweak distribution parameters.  
- **Hands-On Emphasis**:  
  - Short labs (~15–30 min) followed by reflective quizzes.  
  - Provide solution notebooks and encourage customization.  
- **Progressive Difficulty**:  
  - Label each lab with a “complexity meter” (🔹 beginner → 🔷 intermediate → 🔷🔷 advanced).

---

## 🤝 6. Community & Collaboration  
- **Share Notebooks Publicly**: Encourage forking and pull requests.  
- **Weekly “Sampling Challenge”**: Solicit alternative proposal distributions from peers.  
- **Peer Code Reviews**: Rotate reviewers every lab to catch edge-case failures.  
- **Discussion Threads**:  
  - “Why did my ESS drop when I changed my proposal?”  
  - “Showcase: Your rare-event modeling applications.”

---

## 📊 7. Progress Tracking & Reflection  
- **Weekly Checklist**:  
  - Completed visualization of at least three distributions.  
  - Implemented and compared two sampling techniques.  
  - Logged ESS and sampling variance.  
- **Reflection Template**:  
  - **What I Tried:** …  
  - **What Worked / Didn’t:** …  
  - **Questions Arising:** …  
  - **Next Steps:** …  
- **Milestone Celebrations**:  
  - First successful importance sampling (🎉)  
  - Converged Bayesian posterior (🏅)  
  - Completed capstone generative pipeline (🚀)

---

## 🧘 8. Well-Being & Sustainable Learning  
- Take **5–10 min breaks** between heavy math derivations.  
- Use **rubber-band exercises** or quick walks to reset mental focus.  
- Maintain a **growth journal** to record breakthroughs and sticking points.

---

## 🏗️ 9. Architect Mindset Development  
- **Think End-to-End**: How will sampled data flow into your next generative model or RAG pipeline?  
- **Design for Scale**: Can your sampling code handle millions of samples?  
- **Document Assumptions**: Explicitly note where proposals might fail in high dimensions.  
- **Prepare for Integration**: Plan how to wrap these sampling modules into reusable libraries or microservices.
