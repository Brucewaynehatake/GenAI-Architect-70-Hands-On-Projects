# GenAI Architect: From Zero to Production

A structured, modular video series divided into phases (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, and Architect-Level), spanning approximately 60-75 videos for a similar "challenge" feel but with clearer progression. Each phase builds on the previous, incorporating "learning by doing" through integrated mini-projects in every 3-5 videos, culminating in phase-end capstone projects. This ensures hands-on application from scratch (no prior knowledge assumed) to advanced levels, emphasizing architectural thinking: designing scalable, efficient GenAI systems, integrating components, optimizing for production, and addressing real-world challenges like ethics, cost, and performance.

## Key Improvements:
- **Progression**: Logical flow from theory to practice, with prerequisites referenced.
- **Learning by Doing**: Every module includes code-along segments, exercises, and projects using free tools (e.g., Google Colab, Hugging Face, PyTorch/TensorFlow).
- **Video Style**: Short (10-20 min) theory videos + longer (30-60 min) project builds. Include code repos, datasets, and quizzes.
- **Architect Focus**: Dedicated modules on system design, integration, and deployment.
- **Comprehensiveness**: Covers multimodal GenAI, agents, evaluation, and emerging trends up to 2025 (e.g., o1-like reasoning models, efficient inference).
- **Pacing**: 1-2 videos per day, with rest days for project completion, totaling ~75 days if desired.
- **Four phases for a complete learning Journey**.
